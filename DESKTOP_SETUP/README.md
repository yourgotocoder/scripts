To get started with my desktop setup copy this folder anywhere in your fresh Ubuntu 22.04LTS installation. 
This might work for older or newer distros too but I haven't tried it for them so I can only conclude that it will work for v22.04 for now.
Once you have copied the folder in your desktop. You will have to turn the **Desktop_AutoSetup_Sudu.sh** file into an executable file using the **sudo chmod +x Desktop_AutoSetup_Sudu.sh** command. 
The rest should be taken care of by the script.
