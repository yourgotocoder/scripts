# DESKTOP SETUP FOR UBUNTU 22.04

## MY WORKFLOW

<p>
To get started with my desktop setup copy this folder anywhere in your fresh Ubuntu 22.04LTS installation. 
This might work for older or newer distros too but I haven't tried it for them so I can only conclude that it will work for v22.04 for now.
</p>
<p>
Once you have copied the folder in your desktop. You will have to turn the <b>Desktop_AutoSetup_Sudu.sh</b> file into an executable file using the **sudo chmod +x Desktop_AutoSetup_Sudu.sh** command. 
The rest should be taken care of by the script.
