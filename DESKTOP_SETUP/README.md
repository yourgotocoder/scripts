# DESKTOP SETUP FOR UBUNTU 22.04

## MY WORKFLOW

<p>
To get started with my desktop setup copy this folder anywhere in your fresh Ubuntu 22.04LTS installation. 
This might work for older or newer distros too but I haven't tried it for them so I can only conclude that it will work for v22.04 for now.
</p>

<p>
Once you have copied the folder in your desktop. You will have to turn the <b>Desktop_AutoSetup_Sudu.sh</b> file into an executable file using the <b>sudo chmod +x Desktop_AutoSetup_Sudu.sh</b> command. 
The installation should be taken care of by the script.
</p>

### THEME SETUP

<p>Search for gnome-tweaks in your application window that can be accessed using the Windows key. In the gnome-tweak interface select Appearance then select</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>MacOS Cursor Set</b> for <b>Cursor</b></li>
    <li><b>Mojave-CT-Classic</b> for <b>Icons</b></li>
    <li><b>Mojave-Dark</b> for <b>Legacy Applications</b></li>
</ul>
